## Learning objectives

- Write meaningful, semantically correct HTML
- Use modern positioning techniques using the grid or flexbox model
- Create a "pixel-perfect" integration from a given wireframe


## The mission
You've been asked to implement a design for a newly created agency.

The graphic designer gave you all the elements so you can code the thing yourself. You have one day and a half, with the power of flexboxes and grids you should be able to make it!

You must use Sass.

Good luck!
